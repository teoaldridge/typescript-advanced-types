# typescript-advanced-types
In this exercise, I learned about advanced types in TypeScript

I did this exercise as part of my studies with 'Understanding Typescript' by Maximillian Schwarzmuller:
https://www.udemy.com/course/understanding-typescript/

In this exercise, I learned and practiced: 
- Intersection Types
- Type Guards
- Discriminated Unions
- Type Casting
- Index Properties
- Function Overloads
- Optional Chaining
- Nullish Coalescing

To run locally: 
- Download the project files into a local folder 
- Navigate into this project folder in the terminal 
- In terminal type 'npm install' . This will install the node modules packages and recreates the node_modules folder. 
- In terminal type 'npm start' to start the server and open the project in your browser.
- In terminal type 'tsc --watch' to continuously compile all changes you make in the TS files to the JS files.
